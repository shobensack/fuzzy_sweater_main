									<h2>About Fuzzy Sweater</h2>

								<p>
									Fuzzy Sweater is a production (company?) made up of a couple local artists and their friends, working out of a basement
									in the hilly Manayunk section of Philadelphia, PA. Prior to Covid-19, the basement operated as a DIY music venue for
									touring and local bands. As it became unfortunately clear that live music was still a far away dream, Shane &amp; Matt decided
									to take this as an opportunity to put their audio/video skills to use. Taking notes from bigger names like Audiotree and
									KEXP-FM, Fuzzy Sweaters approach to recorded live music emphasizes the intimacy and warmth of a live basement show
									experience.
									<br>
									<br>
									The goal for us is to provide FREE content for local musicians and artists to share with their fans in hopes that we can help do our part to keep the local music thriving. We are still in the process of getting our stuff together, but we are trying to also provide a revenue stream for both ourselves AND the artists we feature through our various outlets.

										<h3>More Than Live Performances</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We started Fuzzy Sweater in order to compensate for the lack of live shows but we are out here to provide more than just that for the local DIY scene. Between our current team we have the ability to help you with stuff like <b>band photo shoots, music videos, album recording, and tons of other stuff</b>. Currently, we are doing this a service to the community while working full time jobs SO we don't go out of our way to advertise it but please feel free to send us a message at <a href = "mailto: fuzzysweaterproductions@gmail.com">fuzzysweaterproductions@gmail.com</a> with any and all questions regarding how we can help you, your band, or business!!!
